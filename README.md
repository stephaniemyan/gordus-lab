# gordus-lab
Data from my rotation in Andrew Gordus's lab in Spring 2019.

The `data` folder contains data from chemotaxis assays, in addition to my scripts for plotting and doing statistical analysis. The raw data is available in this Google Drive folder:

The `cloning` folder contains:

* Genotyping primers for _AID::prg-1_, _AID::hrde-1_, _AID::alg-1_, and mosSCI inserts on ChrIV (used to genotype _gld-1p::tir-1::mRuby_, _sun-1p::tir-1::mRuby_)
* CRISPR templates and sequencing results for _AID::prg-1_

The `rotation_talk` folder contains my rotation talk slides and figures.
